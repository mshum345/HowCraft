Delete example:

This example would be deleting the data we inserted for the cobblestone stairs we have included in the Insert file.

DELETE FROM howtocraft.material WHERE MaterialName = 'Cobblestone';

DELETE FROM howtocraft.item WHERE ItemName = 'Cobblestone Stairs';

DELETE FROM howtocraft.recipe WHERE RecipeID = 1;

DELETE FROM howtocraft.has WHERE RecipeID = 1;

This script would delete all the inserted data related to creating Cobblestone Stairs.
